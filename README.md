- Interactive website where users can search through armor pieces from the game Baldur's Gate 3 and see the different dye options.
- I used HTML, CSS, js, and python for this project.

- I wrote two python programs, one to rename the screenshots I took to make them easy to reference in the code for the dropdown (each has the same dye suffix and the rest changes based on gender/name of armor).
- I also wrote a program for inputting data into a database as I was originally going to use SQLite for all of the information on the armor (title, rarity, image path)

- When it came time to connect that database to the website (which I started building second), it was very unknown territory. Though I learned a lot, I eventually abandoned that idea and since the data was not too large to input manually at this point (each has its own HTML) I focused on the js function instead.

Websites that I referenced quite a lot:
